# Welcome to my little place on the internet!
## Me
I recently received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from UC Davis. I first started after as a biosci major but switched my third year as I wanted something more fun and hands-on. I wanted to create stuff, and having an interest in technology lead me into switching to Computer Science. I enjoyed my long hours in the basement of Kemper Hall working on projects with my friends.

## My Experiences
I am most familiar with C/C++. I have worked on various scripts and a linux shell. Recently the past year I started learning web development. Through creating two sites I learned PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. One of my most recent projects Pinoram.com is my favorite. Itâ€™s a site meant for people to showcase their beautiful pictures from their various trips around the world. I have also worked on some fun stuff like recreating Flappy Bird in CUSP assembly and a couple of simple Android apps.

## My Hobbies
- Hiking
- Lifting
- Eating
- Watching movies
- Overwatch (but Im not too good)
