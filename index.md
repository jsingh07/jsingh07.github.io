# Welcome to my little place on the internet!
## Me
I recently received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from UC Davis. I first started as a bioscience major but switched to CS in my third year. I wanted a career where I could be more involved and hands-on. My passion in technology and interest in the creative process behind software development lead me to switching my major to CS. I enjoyed my long hours in the basement of Kemper Hall working on projects with my friends and hope to work for an organization where I can continue to enjoy the work I do.

I love to learn! I wish to work in a place where I can sharpen my skills and acquire new ones. I find that I would thrive in an environment of collaboration, working alongside people that are new to the industry and experts in it. More than anything else I want grow as a programmer and meet amazing people.

## My experience
I am most familiar with C/C++ but I know other languages such as Java. I have worked on various linux command line programs and a linux shell. Recently, in the past year I started learning web development. In my process of creating two sites, I learned PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. One of my most recent projects Pinoram.com is my favorite. Itâ€™s a site meant for people to showcase pictures from their various trips around the world. I have also worked on some fun projects like recreating Flappy Bird in CUSP assembly and a couple of simple Android apps.

## My hobbies
- Hiking
- Lifting
- Foodie
- Movie fanatic

## What am I learning now? 
Currently I am learning a little bit of Node and React with some Swift thrown in.
